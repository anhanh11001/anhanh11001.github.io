As a GSoC participant and finalist in 2019 with [FOSSASIA](https://github.com/fossasia), I’m always appreciated by how much the open-source community has taught me and how many work opportunities it gave. This post is my detailed advice on getting into GSoC 2020 for upcoming students.


## About Google Summer of Code 2020

As you’re here, you should already know what is GSoC. If not then to keep things short, here are the links to the official GSoC page:

- [What is Google Summer of Code? (including timeline)](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/how-it-works)


- [Requirements for students to apply for the project
Program rules](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/rules)

- [One of the perks of joining GSoC](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/help/student-stipends)


- GSoC Archive — Previous projects and organizations: [2019](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/organizations), [2018](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2018/organizations), [2017](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2017/organizations), [2016](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2016/organizations)

## How to choose an organization and a project?

As you can see there are more than 1000 projects and 200 organizations participated in GSoC every year, so I can understand why so many students ask me about how to choose an organization, especially that the list of official organizations will only come out at the end of February. Here are my method:

- Get to know what is your main strengths, technology stack that you’re confident or passionate about. It can be working with web, mobile apps, programming language, algorithm, AI, big data, hardware-related apps, desktop apps,… GSoC projects are really various in terms of technologies, so you will be able to find an organization that suits you.

- Check out the archive of organizations in the previous year, a lot of them will surely participate in this next. Look at things like: How many times have they participated in GSoC, how many slots do they have compared to other organizations, do their students’ final work report looks good,… Try to find blog posts from their students or reach out to some people from their community, you should be able to find signs on how well the organization supports the students on joining and learning while contributing and how likely will that organization continue to be selected.

- At around January - February, a lot of organizations have already started to post their official “idea list” for GSoC. Just google “GSoC 2020 idea list” at around that time and you should get a lot of results. The idea list is normally the big blocking issues/features that the organization wants to achieve as soon as possible.

- What I would do now is to create an excel sheet containing information like organization name, project name, the technology used, ideas on the project, and columns about the information of the project.

- When looking at a project of an organization, you should check out their project Github page: how their maintainers/reviews respond to an issue/pull requests, how many stars does the project have, insights/contributors, how many students have worked on that project in the previous year (if there is a lot, it shows that the project is highly focused on the organization. So if they have limited slots with different projects, they would choose the students who focus on the most important projects)

- To get to know the organization better, you can find their chat channel on the Github page. Send a message to them to ask and see what is their plan on GSoC. Please never ask for information that you can find somewhere else like How can I contribute? (can be found on CONTRIBUTING.md in their Github page), The program doesn’t run on my computer (because you didn’t follow their installation guidelines),… It’s really annoying. Ask questions that help you get to know the organization better like what are the main issues they want to solve, what projects are highly focused and need contributions,… Don’t be afraid to ask questions.


*After having a clear view of organizations/projects, choose the one you like most. If you are new, I would suggest work on 1 proposal (max 2) proposal but only choose 1 organization to focus on.*

## How to prepare for Google Summer of Code?

- Learn Git well. You should be able to work on different branches, pull/push/rebase code, know what is a conflict and how to resolve it. Check out this course from Udacity to know more about Git/Github.


- Learn the technologies that will use well.


*Let’s assume you already know what organization and project you plan to apply for.*

- Get to know the project’s codebase: Read the contribution guideline. Get to know who is the maintainers. Start reading the codebase and try to solve some beginner issues. You should be able to find a lot of bugs to fix or easy features to work on. If there are no issues to contribute, ask the maintainer. You should also join their chat channel to discuss the thing you find. Remember, it can be overwhelming if you’re new to reading a large codebase, but just spend time, it will work out.

- Try to research for previous year students who join GSoC on that project and ask for their advice as well.


## How to get into Google Summer of Code?
It’s actually really easy. **You will get into GSoC if you show the maintainer of the organization that you can solve problems, issues and get things done for them. **It’s the only thing you should care about when you apply for GSoC.

## How do I show that I can solve problems, issues and get things done?
 **Contributing**. By contributing, I mean to solve bugs, implement features by sending pull requests and review others’ pull request. You can also give feedback for the projects for improvement, write technical blog posts about the technology used in the projects and get more people on board to the project. You should also stay active on their chat channel. If you do those things well before or during the application period, you should be visible to the maintainer and you are good to go.

## About the proposals
The official requirement of the program state that in order to apply for a project, you need to write a proposal. You can submit at most 3 proposals. Here is the thing, based on what I have written above, the proposal is not really that important. A good proposal doesn’t make you a good person who can contribute and solve issues, but the things I mentioned above do.

Still, my advice on proposal is:

- Focus on the issues that are existing and high demand features that need to be implemented. Here is something similar to what my mentor said “Don’t try to send a proposal on implementing fancy Machine Learning model to predict how user are gonna buy what events/products when the payment system is not even working”

- Keep it short (Last year, my organization even made the applicants to only use 3 pages) for the proposal. This also means writing relevant stuff only.

- State how have you contributed to the organization. It can be just a simple URL to the list of all merged PRs.

- State how flexible you are on contributing to other projects of the same organization.


## Some of my other advice

- Don’t be scared if you are new to GSoC, open-source or even programming. I started learning Android only 2 months before the application period, learning to use Git when the organization is announced. And I still land a GSoC project on Android. But I don’t think I was lucky, I was consistent and worked hard to send a PR every day to improve the project. You can do it too.
- If you see a problem/issue that is pending for too long or no one is working on it, you should not ask for permissions but just start working on it and send a PR
- If you have questions about anything related to the project, just ask the question on the chat channel. And answer the questions from other people in the chat channel as well.
- If you have an idea of improving the project, open an issue on that project Github page and ask questions/clarifications/comments from the maintainers or other contributors. It’s much better than inboxing them. In that way, you can also attach that issue URL to your proposal.
